# EncloSys
Inspired by [Shubaruuu's](https://github.com/SHUBARUUU) Github repo [Z-inventory](https://github.com/SHUBARUUU/Z-Inventory). A 2nd year 1st sem prelim project for
the course Data Structures and Algorithms

## Description
Each groups were tasked to create a simple console-based zoo inventory tracking system that can store up to 50 animals.
The program should allow zookeepers to:

- Add new animal records (name, species, age, enclosure number 0â€“4).
- View all registered animals. 
- Search animals by name to see details. 
- Count animals by species. 
- Display animals in a specific enclosure.

This program only uses a single class file. To separate concerns of methods, section three-line headers
were set in place

## Limitations
Advanced data structures like objects, lists, or collections
should be avoided. Only beginner java concepts
